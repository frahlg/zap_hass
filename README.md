## API Data Format

The component connects to your Sourceful Energy Zap via two local API endpoints:

### P1 Energy Data
**API Endpoint:** `http://zap.local/api/data/p1/obis` (or use your Zap's IP address)

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "ts": 1751722190484,
  "data": [
    "0-0:1.0.0(250705142950W)",
    "1-0:1.8.0(00061825.061*kWh)",
    "1-0:2.8.0(00008702.210*kWh)",
    "1-0:3.8.0(00000259.153*kVArh)",
    "1-0:4.8.0(00009399.569*kVArh)",
    "1-0:1.7.0(0000.000*kW)",
    "1-0:2.7.0(0000.385*kW)",
    "1-0:32.7.0(231.2*V)",
    "1-0:52.7.0(235.4*V)",

The component extracts system information and creates diagnostic sensors for device monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No sensors appearing**: 
   - Check that the Sourceful Energy Zap is accessible at the configured host
   - Verify the Zap is connected to your WiFi network
   - Try accessing `http://zap.local/api/data/p1/obis` and `http://zap.local/api/system` in a browser

2. **Connection errors**: 
   - Ensure the Zap is on the same network as Home Assistant
   - If using IP address instead of hostname, verify the correct IP
   - Check that the P1 port on your smart meter is properly connected

3. **Sensor values not updating**: 
   - Check Home Assistant logs for any error messages
   - Verify your smart meter is [compatible](https://intercom.help/sourceful-energy/en/articles/11486814-which-meters-are-compatible-with-zap)
   - Ensure the Zap has a solid connection to your smart meter's P1 port

### Zap Device Setup

If you're having trouble with the Sourceful Energy Zap device itself:

1. **Check the connection**: Ensure the Zap is properly connected to your smart meter's P1 port (RJ12)
2. **WiFi setup**: Make sure the Zap is connected to your WiFi network
3. **Power**: The Zap draws power from the smart meter - no external power needed
4. **Meter compatibility**: Verify your meter is supported using the [official compatibility guide](https://intercom.help/sourceful-energy/en/articles/11486814-which-meters-are-compatible-with-zap)

### Network Discovery

If `zap.local` doesn't work, try:
- Finding the Zap's IP address in your router's device list
- Using network scanning tools to find the device
- Checking your router's DHCP client list for "Sourceful" or "Zap"

### Logging

To enable debug logging, add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.sourceful_zap: debug
```

### Checking Logs

View logs in Home Assistant:
1. Go to **Configuration** → **Logs**
2. Search for "sourceful_zap"

Or check the log file directly:
```bash
grep sourceful_zap home-assistant.log
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Home Assistant development environment
- Python 3.9+
- Access to a P1 Reader device
- Docker (for local validation)

### Local Validation

Before pushing changes, you can run local validation to match the GitHub Actions environment:

```bash
./validate_local.sh
```

This script uses Docker to run the same checks as the CI pipeline:
- Black code formatting
- Python syntax validation  
- JSON file validation

### Code Formatting

The project uses Black for code formatting. To format your code:

```bash
# Using Docker (matches CI environment)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app python:3.10-slim bash -c "pip install black && python -m black custom_components/"

# Or if you have Black installed locally
python -m black custom_components/
```

### Testing

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up a Home Assistant development environment
3. Install the component in development mode
4. Configure with your P1 Reader details
5. Test functionality and sensor updates
